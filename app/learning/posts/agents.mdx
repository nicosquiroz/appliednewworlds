# Part I: Access

So i’ve been thinking for a few weeks now on building some product with my knowledge on AI, agents and such. It’s a good thing that there’s enough attention on this topic and to be in a position of a bit of knowledge to cut through the buzzwords and all the marketing around this. I’ve been fortunate to participate on ai projects in my job, where we’re automating processes in finances with agents. It’s a long path tho, with lot of nuances.

To start, I find the agents concept majestic. Is the very intent of a human being to replicate its thinking. There’s these famous quotes on Turing about machines thinking like humans, and now of humans thinking like machines. Could it be the very nature of humans to create systems in an attempt to replicate themselves? If not a philosophical problem, at least it is useful. All of our tools, from ancient times, are built to expand our own capabilities. They facilitate our own tasks. What’s the limit? A calculator is capable of excelling at mathematical operations beyond our own abilities. A computer is capable of running million of lines of code to execute complex tasks that a human by itself can not comprehend. The world is run on tools, and we have access to this structure (be it the internet, communication systems, information systems, infrastructure, etc.) from a singular point of view. It is then interesting the concept of creating systems that, as us humans, have agency, i.e., the ability to act on their own intentions.

The concept of agents was born long before the marketing term of Agents and Agentic AI. It is the ultimate goal of Artificial intelligence, to create a new form of “self-sustainable” or “living” organism. The task, although, is deeply interlinked with the advancements of mathematics, computer science, computing capabilities and the eyes (money) inverted on it. An agent, by definition, is the system that has the ability to act. Note that in science, a system is a closed or open set of interacting parts that can be understood to have an input or an output (definir sistema xD). This system has boundaries. We can define the boundaries of this system as necessary, as these boundaries are, in nature, arbitrary. There’s no real separation between systems in real life, but we use them to isolate our own understanding of the world. We humans can be understood as an open system interacting with our environment, or other humans. We state that we have agency (as other living systems do) because we experience the world, and we act or react to it. We have a sense of self, and a sense of existence (definir bien esto). We can in some ocations think of ourselves as closed systems, as the boundaries of what is me, or you, are a priori defined by our physical bodies. We can do the same with other systems. A car’s engine can be thought as an isolated system since most of its inner workings (except for energy dissipation) are designed and understood based on an ideal case of isolation from the rest of the world. The inputs and output are gasoline, movement and residues. The question for an agent in the computational sense of the word is, where are these boundaries? Can we define inner systems of beliefs, desire and intention to these agents? What are the capabilities 


## How do we access the world?

A
The distinction used in this work, allows us to hacer 2 cosas.
1. To understand the extent of the explanation power of different theories.
2. To understand how different theories interact, and in that effort, how they should or should not be put together.



For instance, we have the framework theories which … and interaction theories which… .
For the sake of applying this distinction without much thought, which type of theories do we encounter in neuroscience and cognitive sciences? A few statements show it very clearly.

“We discuss the motivation for addressing this question from a normative perspective, which starts from first principles and then unpacks their cognitive and biological implications.”


Framework theories, in this functional distinction, are based on universal principles and frameworks that apply to all systems. Is a property that called my attention while learning about Hopfield Networks and Associative Memories. We can define, in any network-like system, some sort of energy that when minimized can show memory-like behaviors.

_“Active Inference is not just about reading or epistemic foraging. It is, on one view, something that all creatures and particles do, in virtue of their existence. This might sound like a strong claim; however, it speaks to the fact that Active Inference inherits from a free energy principle that equates existence with self-evidencing and self-evidencing with an enactive sort of inference. However, this book is not concerned with the physics of sentient systems. Its focus is on the implications of this physics for understanding how the brain works.”_

What about interaaction theories? Is there an explanation for the causal mechanisms that cause the emergence of consciousness and our undertanding of the world that surrounds it? In some views, is the momentum transfer which defines an interaction, being the building block of “where” the existence of a physical concept is defined. Perhaps there are some other definitions that meet this explanation criteria in another form. But if we are differentiating from principles risen to the status of laws, that rules above all systems; and causal mechanisms that when identified explain (within the framework laws) the emergence of the behaviors we encounter and describe through these laws, brain science (and arguably any observation, description and control of a system in the natural world) seems to align with these hypothesis.

_“This understanding is not an easy business, as witnessed by millennia of natural philosophy and centuries of neuroscience. Although one can find the roots of Active Inference in first principle accounts of self-organized behavior (i.e., variational principles akin to Hamilton’s principle of stationary action), first principles do not help very much when asking how a particular brain works and how it differs from another brain. For example, committing to the theory of evolution by natural selection does not help in the slightest when it comes to understanding why I have two eyes or speak French. This book is about using principles to scaffold key questions in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. To do this, we have to move beyond principles and get to grips with the mechanics to which the principles apply.”_

_“As such, Active Inference—and its accompanying Bayesian mechanics— is there to frame questions about how we perceive, plan, and act. Crucially, it does not aim to replace other frameworks, such as behavioral psychology, decision theory, and reinforcement learning. Rather, it hopes to embrace all those approaches that have proven so successful within a unified frame- work. In what follows, we will pay special attention to linking key con- structs from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, enactivism, ethology, and so on to the calculus of belief updating in Active Inference—and its associ- ated process theories.”_

_“By process theories, we refer to theories about how belief updating is real- ized by neuronal (and other biophysical) processes in the embodied brain and beyond. Work to date in Active Inference offers a fairly straightforward set of computational architectures and simulation tools to both model vari- ous aspects of a functioning brain and enable people to test hypotheses about different computational architectures. However, these tools only solve half the problem.”_

## Highly Customizable

Vim can be extensively customized to suit any developer's preferences and workflow. With a vibrant ecosystem of plugins and a robust scripting language, users can tailor the editor to their specific needs, whether it's programming in Python, writing in Markdown, or managing projects.

This level of customization ensures that Vim remains relevant and highly functional for a wide range of programming tasks and languages.

## Hypothesis on how to start a company

I'll be testing this hypothesis of how to star something.

We dont want to outsource our thinking

The seed system. The seed agent.

1. How do we validate this?

2. How to build a company
